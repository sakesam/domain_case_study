# Lemonade putting traditional agents out of business. 

## Overview and Origin

* The name of the company is Lemonade. 

* The company was incorporated in April 2015.

* The founders of the company are Daniel Schreiber (former president of Powermat) and Shai Wininger (co-founder of Fiverr).

* The idea of the company came about when Schreiber concluded the Insurance industry was ready for tech disruption due to outdated procedures and "Everybody Needs Insurance".  

* The company funding started in December of 2015 with $13 million in seed money from Sequoia Capital and Aleph. In August 2016 the company received $13 million in funding from XL innovate, and in December 2016, $34 million in Series B funding. Finally, in December 2017 Softbank invested $120 million leading to a total estimated funding of $180 million.


## Business Activities

* The specific financial problem Lemonade is solving is the inherent conflict of interest every dollar insurance companies pay out in a claim is a dollar less to the company's bottom line. 

* Lemonade's intended customer base is millennials and the data on the millennial market shows they're the largest population since 2021.

* Lemonade implemented the giveback program which is a system automatically built in to the writing technology Lemonade offers. Lemonade givesback (up to 40% of premiums) because behind the scenes each cohort's premium is used to payout claims.

* They are currently using Artificial Intelligence to make ethical decisions on insurance writing. 


## Landscape

* Lemonade is in the Insurtech domain. 

* The major trends of the past 5-10 years in the industry:
1. Legacy Systems out, digital insurance in 
2. Telematics, UBI and electric vehicles 
3. Cloud Platforms
4. ESG and green Intiatives
5. 5G and Big Data

* Other major companies in this domain are Policy Genius, Clearcover, and GoHealth. 


## Results

* Introduced a self-service, low-friction experience for users optimized with AI. 

* Core metrics used to measure success in the domain: 
1. Gross written premiums (GWP) are the total value of insurance written by a company before deductions. 
2. Gross loss ratio (combined ratio) measure of total incurred losses in relation to total GWP.
3. Revenue per policyholder amount of revenue generated per policyholder serviced.
4. Average policy size average of all policies sold and serviced. 
5. Customer acquisition cost total per new insurance policy or insurance tech sold by customer. 
6. Customer churn rate at which insurance policies or software subs terminate without new policies. 
7. Net promoter score general indicator of customer satisfaction, normally compared to traditional insurance (-100 to 100)
* Based on these metrics, Lemonade is performing very well even considering their higher than-normal loss ratios, mainly incurred due to new product offerings and inflation. However, it is being combatted by switching the core focus to multi-policy bundling amongst existing customers and shifting away from product development and new customer acquisition.  


## Recommendations

* The product I would recommend is health insurance for humans.  

* It would significantly increase their book of business and help their target market (Millenials) become more acclimated with these lines of insurance in a self-service manner. 

* Wearables for insurance risk assessment would be the products utilized. 

* These technologies are appropriate because they will help customers get the correct amount of coverage for their health as opposed to using outdated traditional methods. As well as these technologies fit the model of Lemonade which is redefining the insurance industry through ever-growing technology.
